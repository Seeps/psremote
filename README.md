# psremote

This PowerShell script is used to push and pull files from Windows systems, as well as provide a remote shell for live response. 

When specifying user credentials, the user principal must have access rights to the target system.

Simply execute the script with administrator privileges and select the desired options. Credentials are not cached on the target system, and no user profile is created.
